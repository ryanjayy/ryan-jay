<p style="font-family: Verdana;">
  Many people use the terms <strong >Internet</strong> and the <strong >World Wide Web</strong>  interchangeably,
    but in fact, the two terms are not synonymous. The Internet and the Web are two separated but related things.
       <br></br> The <strong >Internet</strong> is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. It connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which any computer can communicate with other computers as long as they are both
    connected to the internet. Information can travel via the internet via a variety of  languages called <em>"Protocols".</em>
    <br><br>The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> or simply <em>"Web"</em>, is a way of accessing information over
    the medium of the internet. It is an information-sharing model that is built on top of the internet. The Web uses the <strong >HTTP protocol</strong>, only one of the languages spoken over the internet, to transmit data.
