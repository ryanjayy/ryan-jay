   Many people use the terms <strong style="color: tomato;">Internet</strong> and the <strong style="color: tomato;">World Wide Web</strong>  interchangeably,
    <br>but in fact, the two terms are not synonymous. The Internet and the Web are<br>two separated but related thing.<br><br>  The <strong style="color: tomato;">Internet</strong> is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. It <br>connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which any
    <br>computer can communicate with other computers as long as they are both
    <br>connected to the internet. Information can travel via the internet via a variety of <br>languages called <em>"Protocols".</em><br><br>The <strong style="color: tomato;">World Wide Web</strong> or simply <em>"Web"</em>, is a way of accessing information over<br>the medium of the internet. It is an information-sharing model that is built on top <br>of the internet. The Web uses the <strong style="color: tomato;">HTTP protocol</strong>, only one of the languages <br>spoken over the internet, to transmit data.
