    <p>Many people use the terms <strong>Internet</strong> and the <strong>World Wide Web</strong> interchangeably,  but in fact, the two terms are not synonymous. The Internet and the Web are two 
    separated but related things.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. 
    It connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which 
    any computer can communicate with other computers as long as they are both 
    connected to the internet. Information can travel via the internet via a variety of 
    languages called <em>"Protocols"</em>.</p>

    <p>The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> or simply <em>"Web"</em>, is a way of accessing information over 
    the medium of the internet. It is an information-sharing model that is built on top 
    of the internet. The Web uses the <strong>HTTP protocol</strong>, only one of the languages 
    spoken over the internet, to transmit "data.</p>
