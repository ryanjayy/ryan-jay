  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi! I'm Ryan Jay, a passionate and detail-oriented pogi based in Dikildit. I specialize in Application Programming and love creating meaningful, functional, and visually engaging work.

I bring creativity and precision to every project. Whether it's designing user-friendly websites, solving complex problems, or building brand identities, I'm driven by the desire to make ideas come to life.

When I’m not working, you’ll probably find me on basketball court.
Feel free to explore my work, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to collaborate!</p>
